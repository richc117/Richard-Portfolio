						<h3>Radiology Ethnography</h3><br/>
					</div>
					<div class="span6">
						<p>This was a collaborative project involving CAL IT2, Hillcrest and Thornton Hospitals, and the Newschool of Architecture to redesign a radiology reading room. I had the privilege of studying radiologists and how they work in their workspace. After a short time observing the radiologists it became clear that there was very little design considerations in the transition from hard copy scans to digital radiology. </p>
						<p>The goal of this project was to use our workflow models and close descriptions of the radiologist's environment, breakdowns, challengs and communication patterns to form the basis for a set of sketches of a new higher tech radiology suite.</p>

		<div class="span6">
			<p>Short for Wireless Internet Information System for Medical Response in Disasters, I served as part of an ethnography and research team by observing a live natural disaster drill procedures through video ethnographic methods and follow up interviews. Wiisard works to create sophisticated wireless technology to coordinate and enhance care of mass casualties in a terrorist attack or natural disaster. Our goal was to help collect valuable data on how to improve this technology.</p>
			<p>I was also instrumental in the planning and organization of the drill itself. My experience with this project is a testament to my excellent management skills as well as my ability to collect video-ethnographic data.</p>

		<p>This project is a study of distributed creative cognition in dance and choreography. Professor Kirsh and the Interactive Cognition Lab an extensive collection of video data from Dancers all over the world.</p>
		<p>In order to make sense of this data I helped code the video using a program called Elan. This involved noting common patters in Dancer behavior. That coded data could then be used to provide a quantitative analysis. My experience with this project has helped me develop my abilities in mixed methods approach to research; combining both quantitative and qualitative data.</p>

						<p>Other ideas that were presented were a more advanced laser pointer that allowed professors to manipulate media as well as highlight information and a live in class forum that allowed professors, TA's and students with a more efficient way of communicating in the classroom.</p>

						<p>We came up with a plethora of design ideas through brainstorming and visioning sessions. The image the left is an example of some of the designs in the early stages of their development. I learned a great deal from this course both in the way of working effectively in a group as well as the proper way to use the methods of contextual design.</p>

						<h3> About Me </h3><br/>
						<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my online	 portfolio. My name is Richard and I recently graduated from UCSD with a BS in Cognitive Science specializing in Human Computer Interaction and Human Cognition. The curriculum I studied focused on learning how people think, learn, and communicate. The HCI component of my studies introduced me to how I could integrate this knowledge along with user centered design methods to create seamless interaction between humans and computers. This multidisciplinary background gives me an advantage over the pure graphic designer because I have studied information architecture, process flows, site mapping, and how to create wireframes.</p>
